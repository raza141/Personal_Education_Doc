    "#### Object-Relation Mapping (ORM) in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "- ORM is a programming technique that enables interaction between a relational database and an object-oriented programming language.\n",
    "- In Python, various ORM frameworks simplify database interactions by representing database tables as classes, and rows as objects.\n",
    "    - `Table =  Class`\n",
    "    - `Row  = Object`\n",
    "    - `Field = Attribute`\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>***Key Concepts of ORM:***</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**Model Classes:**</u>\n",
    "- Model classes represent entities in your database, such as tables.\n",
    "- Inside the application, `models.py` is a file that contains model classes. \n",
    "    -  `models.Model` argument is used to indicate that the class is a model class. \n",
    "    -  `models.Model` is a class that inherits from the `django.db.models.Model` class.\n",
    "    -  Its primary purpose is to define the structure of the database.\n",
    "- Model Classes are python classes that represent the structure of your database tables. \n",
    "- These model classes are used to define the schema of our database. \n",
    "- Each model class typically corresponds to a table in the database.\n",
    "- Instances of these classes represent rows in the table.\n",
    "        - For example, the `User` class represents a row in the `users` table.\n",
    "- Each model class corresponds to a table, and instances of the class represent rows in that table.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**Attributes and Fields:**</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Class attributes map to fields in the database table.\n",
    "    - For example, the `id` field in the `users` table is an attribute of the `User` class.\n",
    "    - `User.id` is an attribute of the `User` class.\n",
    "- These attributes define the structure of the table.\n",
    "    - For example, the `first_name` and `last_name` fields in the `users` table are attributes of the `User` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**Sessions:**</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "- ORM frameworks use sessions(SQLALchemy) to manage interactions with the database.\n",
    "- On the other hand, Django automatically handles transactions in auto-commit mode, where each database operation is implicitly committed as a seperate transaction.\n",
    "- However, Django also provides ways to manage transactions explicitly using the `transaction` module.\n",
    "    - `transaction.atomic()` or `@transaction.atomic()` to group operations into a single transaction.\n",
    "    - .save() or .delete() to perform database operations in a single transaction in Django.\n",
    "- A session allows you to perform multiple operations and then commit them as a single transaction.\n",
    "    - Django commit all the operations in the session as a single transaction, if even sigle operation fails it will roll back the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**Query Language:**</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "- ORM frameworks provide a query language that allows you to interact with the database using a syntax similar to the programming language, rather than raw SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>***Popular Python ORM Frameworks:***</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Django ORM:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrated with the Django web framework.\n",
    "Uses models to define database structure.\n",
    "Provides a high-level query language.\n",
    "Encourages the use of migrations for database schema changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQLAlchemy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A standalone ORM that can be used with or without a web framework.\n",
    "Provides a powerful and flexible ORM.\n",
    "Offers both high-level and low-level API for database interactions.\n",
    "Widely used in both web and non-web applications."

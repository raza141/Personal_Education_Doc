    "**1. Classes and Objects:**\n",
    "- Class: A blueprint/Template for creating objects. It defines a data structure and behavior.\n",
    "- Object: An instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and has attributes/Properties (data) and methods (functions).\n",
    "- Classes can be accessbed through objects and without object creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**Example:**</u>\n",
    "- ` Instance method :`\n",
    "    - without decorator & used self as a parameter for the method\n",
    "    - we can access class attributes through objects\n",
    "    - we can access instance attributes through objects\n",
    "- `Class method :`\n",
    "    - @classmethod(cls):\n",
    "    - we can access class attributes through class \n",
    "- `Static method :`\n",
    "    - @staticmethod decorator\n",
    "    - we can access class directly without objects creation and class attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Python 3.7 Version Python Introduce the new feature of `@dataclass` decorator for creating data classes:**\n",
    "- `@dataclass` decorator is used for creating data classes.- \n",
    "    - `dataclasses` module is used for creating data classes.\n",
    "    - `dataclass` automatically generates `__init__`, `__repr__` and `__eq__` methods.\n",
    "    - Hence while using `dataclass` we don't need to create `__init__`, `__repr__` and `__eq__` methods explicitly.\n",
    "    - This made code more clean and concise, however while defining the attribute we can explicitly define the type of the attribute, or we can let it on the python which infer the type of the attribute while run time, this dynamically typing make Python robust. \n",
    "    - `__eq__` method is used to check whether two objects are equal or not.\n",
    "    - `@dataclass(frozen=True)` This function is used to make the class immutable, i.e. once the object is created, it can't be modified.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**`@dataclass Inheritance`**\n",
    "- We can inherit the data class from another data class, same as do without using `@dataclass` feature, refer to example. \n",

    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Mention in coding section. \n",

    "        - We use _ before the attribute name to make it private.\n",
    "    - Protected attributes.\n",
    "        - Protected attributes are attributes that can only be accessed within the class and its subclasses.\n",
    "        - We use __ before the attribute name to make it protected.\n",

    "    - Low level abstraction.\n",
    "- We can achive the abstraction for a class or method by using abstract classes and abstract methods.\n",
    "    - Using the `module abc` abc stands for abstract base classes.\n",
    "- To make a abstract class we should have at least one abstract method in it.\n",
    "- `Abstract methods` have only declaration and no implementation nor definition.\n",
    "- To make the method abstract we should use the `@abstractmethod` decorator. \n",
    "    - For example: \n",
    "        - from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "        - class Shape(ABC):\n",

    "- Once we create abstract class we can't create an object of the class and we can't instantiate the class. \n",
    "- We should use the seperate file for the abstract class from the main fil, to avoid the error.\n",
    "- If `base class` use the abstract class then `derived class` should also use the abstract class.\n",
    "- This abstract method just show the functionality of the class, not the implementation.\n",
    "- One file for abstract class and one file for the implementation class, then we can create another main file and import here. \n",
